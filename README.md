# Remote Access Application Framework

the task is to create a framework that streams an application's rendering output to a remote PC and sends the user input back to the server, allowing the client to "run" the application without having the hardware requirements

the goal is to enable users to use specific hardware on a server without the need to have it at home (such as in a university context, being able to learn ray tracing)
